      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Perfect Glow was founded by <strong>Tariro Gwesu</strong>, a passionate artisan 
        who dreamed of bringing wellness and luxury into everyday routines. Tariro‚Äôs journey 
        began with a simple desire: to create safe, sustainable, and indulgent skincare products 
        free from harsh chemicals. Inspired by nature and guided by craftsmanship, Tariro transformed 
        this vision into Perfect Glow‚Äîa sanctuary of purity, wellness, and beauty.
