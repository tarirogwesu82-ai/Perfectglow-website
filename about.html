                At <strong>Perfect Glow</strong>, we believe that true beauty begins with nature. 
                Every bar of soap we create is more than just a cleansing product its a piece of 
                self-care, carefully crafted to nurture your skin and soul.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our soaps are handmade with love, using only the finest natural ingredients. 
                From soothing essential oils to nourishing butters and herbal infusions, every blend 
                is designed to bring out your natural radiance while being gentle on your skin 
                and kind to the environment.

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Perfect Glow was founded by <strong>Tariro Gwesu</strong>, a passionate artisan 
                who dreamed of bringing wellness and luxury into everyday routines. Tariro’s journey 
                began with a simple desire: to create safe, sustainable, and indulgent skincare products 
                free from harsh chemicals. Inspired by nature and guided by craftsmanship, Tariro transformed 
                this vision into Perfect Glow—a sanctuary of purity, wellness, and beauty.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today, every bar of soap we make carries the same dedication and artistry, ensuring that 
                when you use Perfect Glow, you're not just washing your skin—you're embracing a ritual of self-love.
            </p>
