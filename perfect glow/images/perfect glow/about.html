      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Perfect Glow was founded by <strong>Tariro Gwesu</strong>, a passionate artisan 
        who dreamed of bringing wellness and luxury into everyday routines. Tariro’s journey 
        began with a simple desire: to create safe, sustainable, and indulgent skincare products 
        free from harsh chemicals. Inspired by nature and guided by craftsmanship, Tariro transformed 
        this vision into Perfect Glow—a sanctuary of purity, wellness, and beauty.
      </p>

        Today, every bar of soap we make carries the same dedication and artistry, ensuring that 
        when you use Perfect Glow, youre not just washing your skin—youre embracing a ritual of self-love.
